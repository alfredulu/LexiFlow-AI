## 🔒 Notes on Security

This project performs AI requests directly from the frontend using environment variables. For production or public deployments, API requests should be proxied through a backend service to avoid exposing sensitive keys.

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- Tone, length, and audience controls
- Saved projects using local storage or a backend
- Editable sections with selective regeneration
- Additional export formats (DOCX, Markdown, TXT)
- Authentication and user accounts
